London
It has beautiful buildings.
There are lots of things to see and do.
It has good shopping.
It's expensive to live there.

Dear sir,

I'm writing about the dog owners in our Town.
I'm very unsatisfied how they look after their dogs.
They walk them without leashes and muzzles and don't
clean after them.I would like heavier punishments
for the owners and someone to watch them if they
don't follow the rules.

I look forward to hearing from you.

embittered citizen.
